# Visualize

Visualization of projects is really important when you are trying to understand any code project. Wouldn't it be useful to have a reliable map while navigating through this labyrinth. This project helps in building such a handy map. Just install our chrome extension and enable yourself to dive into opensource code bases like never before! The extension currently supports js and ts based projects.
